# Python_project
This is my first project outside of university. I'm doing this to practice and get better at Python.

Link to the video that helped me do this project:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTD86h69PtE&list=PLZJBfja3V3Rsbiz84Z63IXnTQZH_Rnfuo&index=13

The goal of this project is to create an app that helps the user track their expenses.
Here are the requirements of the app:
- The user will enter their expenses
- The expenses will be saved to a CSV file
- The app will summarise the totals of the expenses
- The app will show the remaining budget
